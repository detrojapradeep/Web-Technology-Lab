/* divs and span are used for grouping itslef */

.red {
  color: red;
}
.green {
  color: green;
}

/* spans are used when we want to style something in the line itself */
/* we could also use div here, but it'll put the style in next line */
span {
  color: blue;
}

--> Inheritance- CSS property passes on from the parent to the child, unless overwritten in any stage
** there are some properites which are not inherited, eg- border property

--> Last rule- if your'e adding more than one CSS style to a element, the last one is gonna implement
eg.
p{
    color: blue;
}
p{
    /* red will be displayed */
    color: red; 
}

--> Specificity- if there are two or more conflicting css rules, then the one with more specificity will win.
--> Specificity heirarchy-
1)inline styles
2)ID
3)Class
4)elements

--> Universal selectors (*) - this is used to select everything, but it has the least specificity
